Map {
    Region {
        Zone {
            Area {
                Plot {
                    Tile {
                        Obj {}
                        Mob {}
                    }, Tile{...}

            }, Area{...}
        }, Zone{...}
    }, Region{...}
}

Map -> Region -> Zone -> Area -> Plot -> Tile
Mob and Obj live within Tile

Each layer is of interface type Gridded, which holds a 2D dictionary(map) with keys as dict[x] == dict
so that dict[x][y] = child (type Tangible) all the way down to Tile, which is NOT Gridded, as it represents a singular point on the map

A map generator will use a seed and algorithm to generate a map at runtime
The first cycle wont have any saving functionality; this is meant to be a single play run for practice and educational purposes for learning Go and
having something to show for it

Basic progression of the game will include logging in, setting basic fields for a character, picking a class, entering a starting zone,
talking to npcs, doing quests, gathering loot and gear, and fighting pve (npcs and monsters)
